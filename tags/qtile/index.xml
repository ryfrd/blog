      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a person who has spent an unreasonable amount of time making minute changes to the appearance of my bar in qtile. Despite the very nice selection of widgets availabe by default with qtile, it was only a matter of time before I decided I wanted to experiment with making my own custom widget. Fortunately, if you can do a bit of python this is quite an approachable undertaking.
The dream widget I was lacking was a little live crikcet score ticker type thing; something which would scroll along on my bar showing me the score in live cricket matches.</description>

      <description>This post is going to detail how I solved a very particular problem I had created for myself. First, a quick description of the problem. I use home-manager on nixos to declaratively configure what happens on my computer. In the cases where home-manager does not expose sufficient configuration options for my liking (qtile for example), I instead link a configuration file from my nixos config to where it belongs in my home using xdg.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you could do this until recently, very fun and playful little feature. How you want to do it will depend slightly on how you have your groups set up but I start with importing the relevant libraries and defining an empty list.
from libqtile.config import Dropdown, Scratchpad groups = [] I&amp;rsquo;m then able to append all the groups I want to this list. For the dropdown terminal you need the ScratchPad group which to quote the qtile docs is a &amp;ldquo;special - by default invisible - group which acts as a container for DropDown configurations&amp;rdquo;.</description>
