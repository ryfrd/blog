      <description>I recently started fiddling around with home-managerifying my neovim config. After moving across most of my stuff I came across the problem of how to hook things up with with nix-colors so that my neovim theme would follow color changes in home-manager.
Luckily, I came across this handy little plugin from the lovely mini.nvim suite of plugins which lets you create your own theme with your custom colors.
Beneath is a little snippet of how you could make it all happen.</description>

      <description>As I fall deeper and deeper down the nixos rabbit hole, I find myself becoming more and more obsessed with controlling every little thing on my computers declaratively. It starts with: &amp;lsquo;oh this is cool I can specify which desktop environment to use in my configuration.nix&amp;rsquo;. Next thing you know you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered home-manager and every program on every linux system you use needs to be controlled in your nix-config. Of course this slightly insane approach has its downsides; it also opens some doors though.</description>

      <description>This post is going to detail how I solved a very particular problem I had created for myself. First, a quick description of the problem. I use home-manager on nixos to declaratively configure what happens on my computer. In the cases where home-manager does not expose sufficient configuration options for my liking (qtile for example), I instead link a configuration file from my nixos config to where it belongs in my home using xdg.</description>

      <title>declarative firefox config with home-manager on nixos</title>

      <description>As a man who finds himself reinstalling his OS more than is probably sensible, any opportunity to minimise the post install admin of sorting out all your settings is an attractive one. With that in mind lets take a look at some of the firefox (my current browser of choice) configuration options avilable to you through home-manager. This assumes you have some sort of home-manager setup working. If you do not I found this friendly githubber&amp;rsquo;s templates to be very helpful.</description>
