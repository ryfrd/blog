      <description>I recently started fiddling around with home-managerifying my neovim config. After moving across most of my stuff I came across the problem of how to hook things up with with nix-colors so that my neovim theme would follow color changes in home-manager.
Luckily, I came across this handy little plugin from the lovely mini.nvim suite of plugins which lets you create your own theme with your custom colors.
Beneath is a little snippet of how you could make it all happen.</description>
