      <description>When I first started messing around with hugo, I found the whole thing slihtly mystifying. I downloaded a theme like they asked me, edited the config file to try and customise things a little and quickly broke everything.

But anyway, the point at which I started to really appreciate the power of hugo was when I tried to make my own - admittedly less feautureful - theme.</description>
