      <description>For a little while now I&amp;rsquo;ve been running some services (jellyfin etc.) on an old laptop in my house. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to sound like a podcast ad but as a networking novice, the simplicity tailscale brings to accessing these services remotely is very nice. Until recently though, I had been accessing my services like a heathen with http and port numbers (eg http://tailscale-ip:service-port). This works and is perfectly secure thanks to tailscale though it lacks a certain finesse.</description>
