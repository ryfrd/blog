  <date>26 Jun 2023</date>
  <p>Sometimes when I&rsquo;m trawling the internet and happen upon a particularly nice looking website, I develop css and javascript FOMO. The thing I&rsquo;ve been lusting after above all else is one of those fancy little dark theme toggle buttons. As you can probably tell from the website you&rsquo;re looking at my web dev skills are limited. As a result of this I had assumed such niceties were out of reach.</p>

  <date>16 May 2023</date>
  <p>For a little while now I&rsquo;ve been running some services (jellyfin etc.) on an old laptop in my house. I&rsquo;m not trying to sound like a podcast ad but as a networking novice, the simplicity tailscale brings to accessing these services remotely is very nice. Until recently though, I had been accessing my services like a heathen with http and port numbers (eg http://tailscale-ip:service-port). This works and is perfectly secure thanks to tailscale though it lacks a certain finesse.</p>

  <h4><a href="/posts/writing-a-qtile-widget/">learning about qtile widgets via the medium of cricket</a></h4>
  <date>3 Apr 2023</date>
  <p>I&rsquo;m a person who has spent an unreasonable amount of time making minute changes to the appearance of my bar in qtile. Despite the very nice selection of widgets availabe by default with qtile, it was only a matter of time before I decided I wanted to experiment with making my own custom widget. Fortunately, if you can do a bit of python this is quite an approachable undertaking.
The dream widget I was lacking was a little live crikcet score ticker type thing; something which would scroll along on my bar showing me the score in live cricket matches.</p>
